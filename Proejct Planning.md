Phase 1. Project Setup and Frontend Development

1.1.Setup: Create a new Git repository. Initialize the project structure. Set up the Node.js backend with Express. Configure MySQL database and Sequelize ORM. Implement basic authentication.

1.2.Frontend Setup: Create a new React.js project. Set up a basic project structure with components. Implement routing using React Router. Integrate state management (Redux or Context API).

1.3.User Authentication (Frontend): Create login and registration components. Implement user authentication using proper error handling.

1.4.Project Member Interface: Create Project Member component. Implement functionality to add projects and define deliverables. Integrate video upload or link submission.

Phase 2: Backend Development


2.1. RESTful API (Backend): Define API routes for users, projects, deliverables, grades. Implement authentication middleware. Ensure that endpoints return appropriate status codes.

2.2 Database Integration: Define Sequelize models for database entities. Implement CRUD operations for users, projects, deliverables, and grades. Establish relationships between models.

2.3 Business Logic (Backend): Implement logic for random jury selection. Develop the grading logic with anonymous grading and grade calculation. Enforce grading modification constraints.

2.4 Error Handling and Security: Implement error handling in the backend. Enhance security measures, including input validation.


Phase 3: Frontend Refinement and Jury Interface

3.1 Jury Interface (Frontend): Create Jury component. Implement the interface for grading projects. Ensure the anonymity of grades and proper UI feedback.

3.2 Grading System (Backend-Frontend Integration): Connect the frontend grading interface with backend grading logic. Test the complete flow of project evaluation.

3.3 Modify Grades (Frontend): Implement the ability for jury members to modify their grades within the specified time frame.

Phase 4. Professor Interface and Documentation

4.1 Professor Interface (Frontend): Create Professor component.
Implement the interface for professors to view project evaluation results without revealing jury identities.

4.2 API Documentation: Document the API endpoints, expected request/response formats, and authentication requirements. Update README with setup instructions.

4.3 Code Documentation: Add comments to classes, functions, and critical code blocks.
Ensure the codebase is well-documented and follows a consistent naming standard.

Phase 5. Testing and Quality Assurance (Optional)

5.1Unit Testing: Write unit tests for critical functions and components.

5.2Integration Testing: Test the interaction between frontend and backend components.

5.3Test Coverage: Measure test coverage and improve it if necessary.

Phase 6: Deployment and Final Checks

6.1 Deployment: Gradually deploying updates in secondary branches. The final form of the project will be uploaded in the main branch.

6.2 Final Checks:Perform a thorough review of the application.Test the deployed application to ensure proper functionality.

6.3 Submission:Prepare the application for submission.Provide any necessary credentials or access information.
