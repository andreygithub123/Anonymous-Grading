# Anonymous-Grading

This project aims to create an user-friendly and easy to use interface for grading student projects, but it comes with a catch: students grade other students.
The client ( student in our case) will login to the platform in order to upload its project and will be classified as a student and has a chance to become part of the jury of another project by being randomly selected for this purpose. Students that are not part of any project team can also be chosen to represent the jury in any project. The jury will grade the project from 1-10 and its mark will not be visible to other jury members or the coordinating professor. The professor will make an average of the grades and will save the final mark for the teams.
